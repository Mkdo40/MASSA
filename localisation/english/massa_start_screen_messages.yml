 START_SCREEN_TENTACLED_SYMBIOSIS: "Half a century has passed since the asteroid called 'The Great Seed' struck our world. From crater created by the Great Seed rose our civilization's first proof of life beyond our homeworld. At first the tentacled lifeforms caused great fear in our people: riots, wars, the use of gas weapons and even nuclear weapons. The tentacled lifeforms weathered all of this, as did we. In time we learned not to fear them. In fact we learned to live alongside them and use them to catapult our civilization into the next age. While we know that they possess an intellect far superior to that of most animals, the question of whether they are sapiant or not has yet to be answered."
